This project is intended as a scratchpad for creating adhoc tests
for learning purposes. 

Don't check in any changes to this project - it should contain only this
readme file. 

To run any adhoc tests you create here, you will have to open the
adhoc-tests assembly in NUnit. The output of this project is not
part of the normal NUnit test run.
