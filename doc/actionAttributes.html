<h2>Action Attributes (NUnit 2.6)</h2>

<h4>Note: This is an experimental feature in the NUnit 2.6 Beta release and may change in the final release.</h4>

<p><b>Action Attributes</b> are a feature of NUnit designed to better enable composability of test logic. Often 
when writing unit tests we have logic that we want to run upon certain events in the test cycle (e.g. SetUp, 
TearDown, FixtureSetUp, FixtureTearDown, etc.). NUnit has had the ability to execute code upon these events by 
decorating fixture classes and methods with the appropriate NUnit- provided attributes. <b>Action Attributes</b>
allow the user to create custom attributes to encapsulate specific actions for use before or after any test
is run.

<h3>The Problem of Composability</h3>

<p>Suppose we have some tests in multiple fixtures that need the same in-memory test database to be created and 
destroyed on each test run. We could create a base fixture class and derive each fixture that depends on the test 
from that class. Alternatively, we could create a <b>SetUpFixture</b> class at the level of a common namespace
shared by each fixture. 

<p>This works fine, until we need some other reusable functionality, say the ability to configure or reset a 
ServiceLocator. We could put that functionality in the base fixture class or setup fixture, but now we're mixing 
two different responsibilities into the base class. In the case of a setup fixture, this only works if all classes
requiring both features are located in a common namespace. In some cases we may *not* want the test database, but 
we do want ServiceLocator configuration; and sometimes we want the opposite. Still other times we'll want both
 - so we'd have to make the base class configurable.

<p>If we now discover a third piece of functionality we need to reuse, like configuring the Thread's CurrentPrincipal 
in arbitrary ways, the complexity of the solution very quickly. We've violated the Single Responsibility Principle 
and are suffering for it. What we really want is the ability to separate the different pieces of resuable test logic 
and compose them together as our tests need them.

<h3>Resolving the Problem</h3>

<p><b>Action Attributes</b> get us out of our bind. Consider this example:

<div class="code"><pre>
[TestFixture, ResetServiceLocator]
public class MyTests
{
 [Test, CreateTestDatabase]
 public void Test1() { /* ... */ }

 [Test, CreateTestDatabase, AsAdministratorPrincipal]
 public void Test2() { /* ... */ }

 [Test, CreateTestDatabase, AsNamedPrincipal("charlie.poole")]
 public void Test3() { /* ... */ }

 [Test, AsGuestPrincipal]
 public void Test4() { /* ... */ }
}
</pre></div> 

<p>Here we have used attributes to identify five different actions
that we want to compose together in different ways for different tests:
<ul>
  <li>ResetServiceLocator
  <li>CreateTestDatabase
  <li>AsAdministratorPrincipal
  <li>AsNamedPrincipal
  <li>AsGuestPrincipal
</ul>
We can reuse these actions in other test fixtures, simply by decorating
them with the appropriate attributes.without having to inherit from a base class.
We can even develop and distribute a library of common test actions.

<h3>Implementing an Action Attribute</h3>

<p>Any attribute can be an action attribute. To create an action attribute, create a class that inherits 
from <b>System.Attribute</b> and implement either ITestSuiteAction or ITestCaseAction. Each interface has 
a Before and After method that must be implemented.

<div class="code"><pre>
    public interface ITestAction
    {
    }

    public interface ITestSuiteAction : ITestAction
    {
        void BeforeTestSuite(object fixture, MethodInfo method);

        void AfterTestSuite(object fixture, MethodInfo method);
    }

    public interface ITestCaseAction : ITestAction
    {
        void BeforeTestCase(object fixture, MethodInfo method);

        void AfterTestCase(object fixture, MethodInfo method);
    }
</pre></div>

<p>When an attribute that implements <b>ITestSuiteAction</b> is applied to either a class or a parameterized 
method, NUnit will execute the attribute's <b>BeforeTestSuite</b> method prior to executing the test suite
and then execute the <b>AfterTestSuite</b> method after the test suite has finished executing. This is similar 
to how the <b>TestFixtureSetUp</b> and <b>TestFixtureTearDown</b> attributes work.

<p>Likewise, when an attribute that implements <b>ITestCaseAction</b> is applied to either a class or method 
(that represents a test case), NUnit will execute the attribute's <b>BeforeTestCase</b> method prior to 
executing the test case, and then execute the <b>AfterTestCase</b> method after the test case has finished 
executing. This is similar to how the SetUp and TearDown attributes work.

<h3>Example</h3>

<div class="code" style="width: 44em"><pre>
[AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Method | AttributeTargets.Class |
                AttributeTargets.Interface | AttributeTargets.Assembly,
                AllowMultiple = true)]
public class ConsoleActionAttribute : Attribute, ITestSuiteAction, ITestCaseAction
{
    private string _Message;

    public ConsoleActionAttribute(string message) { _Message = message; }

    public void BeforeTestSuite(object fixture, MethodInfo method)
    {
        WriteToConsole("Before Suite", fixture, method);
    }

    public void AfterTestSuite(object fixture, MethodInfo method)
    {
        WriteToConsole("After Suite", fixture, method);
    }

    public void BeforeTestCase(object fixture, MethodInfo method)
    {
        WriteToConsole("Before Case", fixture, method);
    }

    public void AfterTestCase(object fixture, MethodInfo method)
    {
        WriteToConsole("After Case", fixture, method);
    }

    private void WriteToConsole(string eventMessage, object fixture, MethodInfo method)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("{0}: {1}, from {2}.{3}.",
            eventMessage,
            _Message,
            fixture != null ? fixture.GetType().Name : "{no fixture}",
            method != null ? method.Name : "{no method}");
    }
}
</pre></div>

<p>Note that the above Action Attribute implements both ITestSuiteAction and ITestCaseAction.
   This is permitted, but will probably not be the normal case. The attribute takes a single 
   constructor argument, a message, that will be used to write output to the console. All of
   the Before and After methods write output via the WriteToConsole method.
