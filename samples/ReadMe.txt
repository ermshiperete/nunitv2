NUnit Samples

This directory contains sample applications using NUnit.



Compiling in Visual Studio

A Visual Studio 2003 project file is included or each sample. 
Visual Studio 2005 will convert the format automatically upon
opening it.

In most cases, you will need to remove and the reference to the
nunit.framework assembly and replace it with a reference to 
your installed copy of the framework.
