Version 1.2.2 - (2008-03-27)
----------------------------

* null cannot be used as argument on .NET Framework 1.1. A new enum value SpecialValue.Null can be
  used instead. If the RowTest addin finds this value as argument the value will be translated to
  null.

  methods.

  TestSuite.
* Fixed Bug: When a TestFixture contains both RowTests and normal unit tests the row tests
  are not alphabetically ordered.
